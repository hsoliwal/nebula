Welcome to the [Eclipse Nebula project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.nebula).

This repository contains a large set of UI elements that can be used in applications based on Java and SWT.
See [Nebula Widgets](https://github.com/EclipseNebula/nebula/blob/master/docs/Widgets.md) for information about the available widgets.
